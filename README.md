# bangor-benchmark `0.1 pre-alpha`
The Bangor benchmark is a standard unity project designed to aid with the rapid development of agent-based AI simulations. It helps remove boilerplate and redundant code, and provides a steady base for development to commence upon.

The benchmark project contains a number of scenes, as well as different NPCs, weapons and environments. Examples of each are included within the project, and we strongly encourage you to explore the examples provided. Furthermore, various interfaces have been developed so you can extend the project with your own created content.

This project is still in the development phase, and as such, there is not much support or guidance to using the benchmark project. In later versions where the project has reached a significant stage of development, more support will be provided for the usage of the tools included in the project.
